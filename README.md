# Traffic Light with Javascript DOM

This project focuses on creating a traffic light simulation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The initial version uses DOM manipulation to control the lighting sequence of red, yellow, and green lights with set durations (3 seconds, 2 seconds, 3 seconds) using setTimeout for precise timing. The project utilizes CSS opacity to differentiate between "on" (bright) and "off" (dim) states, maintaining the default colors (red, orange, green). The layout is styled with flexbox for centered, responsive alignment across devices. The JavaScript logic ensures a continuous cycle of the traffic light sequence.
